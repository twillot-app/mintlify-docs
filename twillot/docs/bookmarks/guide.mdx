Twillot supports various search methods, closely mirroring X/Twitter's search syntax to reduce your learning curve.

## Keyword Search

Enter keywords in the top search box, press Enter or click the search button to quickly search. Results will appear within milliseconds, as the query is local and does not go through any server.

## Search Bookmarks by Specific User

Similar to keyword search, enter the text in the format `from:[username]` to search bookmarks from a specific user.

```text
from:dotey
```

## Search Bookmarks After a Specific Date

Similar to keyword search, enter the text in the format `since:[start_date]`

```text
since:2024-06-01
```

## Search Bookmarks Before a Specific Date

Similar to keyword search, enter the text in the format `until:[end_date]`

```text
until:2024-06-22
```

## Search Bookmarks Within a Date Range

Combine since and until, like `since:2024-06-01 until:2024-06-22`

```text
since:2024-06-01 until:2024-06-22
```

## Combine Keywords / User / Date to Search Bookmarks

Add different search conditions separated by spaces to freely combine them, as shown below:

```text
AI from:dotkey since:2024-06-01 until:2024-06-22
```

This will search for bookmarks containing the keyword `AI` posted by user [dotey](https://x.com/dotey) between June 1, 2024, and June 22, 2024.

<Tip>
  Users familiar with X/Twitter will find Twillot's search methods very similar.
