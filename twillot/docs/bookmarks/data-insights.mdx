## Bookmark Activity

After bookmark sync is complete, you can use visual charts to see the number of bookmarks you saved each day over the past year.

<Warning>
  Strictly speaking, the time here corresponds to the creation date of the
  bookmark, not the date it was saved. This is because X/Twitter does not
  provide the save date.
</Warning>

## Bookmark Leaderboard

You can see the top ten users whose tweets you have bookmarked the most, helping you better understand your bookmarking preferences. Click on the user's avatar in the leaderboard to view the list of bookmarks posted by that user.
