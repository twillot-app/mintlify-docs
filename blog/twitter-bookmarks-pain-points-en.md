description: "Understand the main issues with Twitter bookmarks in 2024 and their impact on user experience."
---

While the Twitter bookmark feature is convenient, there are still many issues in actual use. This article will explore these pain points in detail and provide some possible solutions.

## 1. Unable to Search Bookmarks

Twitter bookmarks currently do not support a search function, making it very difficult for users to find previously saved content. Users can only browse through pages, which is inefficient and makes it hard to find specific bookmarks.

### Solution

Twitter could consider introducing a bookmark search function, allowing users to quickly find bookmarks by keywords, dates, or authors.

## 2. Request Timeout

Frequent requests to the bookmark interface can easily result in timeout errors, severely affecting user experience. This is especially evident when the network is unstable or Twitter's servers are under heavy load.

### Solution

Optimize the request mechanism to improve server response speed and reduce the occurrence of timeout errors.

## 3. Limited Folder Functionality

Twitter's folder feature is not available to free users and is quite rudimentary. Folders do not display the number of bookmarks and do not support search, making bookmark management difficult.

### Solution

Twitter could consider opening up some folder features to free users and adding bookmark count display and search functionality to improve user experience.

## 4. No Backup Function for Bookmarks

Twitter bookmarks do not have a backup function. If the original tweet is deleted, the saved bookmark will also disappear. This is a significant loss for users.

### Solution

Twitter could introduce a bookmark backup function, allowing users to export bookmarks to local or cloud storage to prevent data loss.

## 5. Insufficient Bookmark Categorization

Currently, Twitter bookmarks do not have a categorization display function. Users cannot distinguish between different types of content such as text, images, GIFs, videos, links, articles, and quotes.

### Solution

Twitter could add a bookmark categorization display function to help users better manage and find different types of bookmarks.

## 6. Lack of Bookmarking Behavior Records

Twitter bookmarks do not have bookmarking behavior records, making it impossible for users to visualize their bookmarking history. This makes it difficult for users to understand their bookmarking habits and preferences.

### Solution

Twitter could introduce a bookmarking behavior record function, providing a visual bookmarking history to help users better understand and manage their bookmarked content.

## 7. Poor Infinite Scrolling Experience

When viewing bookmark data, users need to scroll down infinitely, which is a very poor experience, especially when there are many bookmarks.

### Solution

Twitter could optimize the bookmark viewing interface by using pagination or other more efficient ways to display bookmark data, improving user experience.

## 8. No Keyword/Author/Date Search Support

Twitter bookmarks do not support searching by keyword, author, or date, making it very inconvenient for users to find specific bookmarks.

### Solution

Twitter could add a bookmark search function, allowing users to quickly find bookmarks by keyword, author, or date, improving efficiency.

By solving the above pain points, Twitter can greatly improve the user experience of the bookmark function, making it more practical and convenient. As of 2024-07-07, these problems have not been solved. Twitter does not seem to be able to provide a perfect solution in the short term, but you can choose to use Twillot as a bookmark management tool.
